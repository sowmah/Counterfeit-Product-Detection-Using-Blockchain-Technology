# Counterfeit-Product-Detection-Using-Blockchain-Technology
Project Overview: 

Developed a Blockchain-based System to detect and prevent counterfeit products. Product counterfeiting has become the main problem and identifying the original and fake products is very difficult. Using a QR Code we can easily find out whether the product is Authentic or not on the Block chain System using Block chain, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Problem Statement:

With the rise of counterfeit products, manufacturers are facing significant challenges in protecting their brand name, ensuring customer safety, and maintaining revenue. Fake manufacturers often sell substandard products at lower prices, leading to potential losses and harm to the consumer. To address this, we propose a system using Blockchain and QR codes to verify the authenticity of products and prevent counterfeiting.

Technologies Used:

- Blockchain: Used for storing product data in a secure and immutable digital ledger.
- QR Code: Provides a means for customers to scan and verify product authenticity using a mobile or web application.
- Python: Used for the backend development of the system.
- QR Code Scanner: Allows consumers to scan the product's QR code to access Blockchain data.
  
How It Works:

Product Registration:

When a manufacturer registers a new product, the details of the product (e.g., name, model, batch number, manufacturer) are stored on the blockchain as an immutable record.
A QR code is generated for each product, containing a unique identifier linked to its Blockchain record.

Product Verification:

Customers or end-users can scan the product's QR code using a mobile or web app.
The app fetches the product's data from the Blockchain to verify its authenticity.
The system checks whether the QR code matches the recorded data on the Blockchain and alerts the user if the product is counterfeit.

Decentralization & Security:

Blockchain technology ensures that the product data is secure, decentralized, and cannot be altered, preventing fraudulent activities.

User Interface:

A simple and user-friendly interface is provided for customers to scan QR codes and instantly receive product verification information.
